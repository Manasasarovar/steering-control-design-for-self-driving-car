# steering-control-design-for-self-driving-car
A discrete time Linear Quadratic Regulator (LQR) for a self-driving car steering system
he following concepts central to control theory and controller design.

1) PID Control
2) LQR Control
3) Discrete and Continuous Control
4) Laplace and Z Domain
5) Discretization Methods: Step Invariance, Impulse Invariance, Zero Order Hold (ZOH) etc.
6) Samping and Pole Zero Matching
7) Linear Quadratic Integration (LQI) Control
8)
